# FARMMASTER - Land Report Delivery System

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Send Reports to Land Owners

### Problem Solved:
- **Issue**: Field supervisors' reports were stored but not accessible to land owners
- **Solution**: Created a complete workflow for operational managers to send reports directly to land owners

### 🔧 Technical Implementation:

#### Backend Files Created:
1. **`send_to_landowner.php`** - Handles sending reports to land owners
2. **`demo_landowner_reports.php`** - Retrieves reports for land owners
3. **`sent_reports.json`** - Stores delivery tracking data

#### Frontend Updates:
1. **`LandReportManagement.jsx`** - Enhanced with detailed success messages
2. **`LandReportReview.jsx`** - "Send to Land Owner" button functionality
3. **`LandReportBody.jsx`** - Land owners can now view their reports

## 🎯 How It Works:

### For Operational Managers:
1. **Review Reports**: View all land reports in the Land Report Review & Approval table
2. **Send to Owner**: Click "Send to Land Owner" button after reviewing
3. **Confirmation**: Get detailed success message with:
   - ✅ Report ID
   - 👤 Land Owner name
   - 📅 Sent timestamp
   - 🎯 Delivery confirmation

### For Land Owners:
1. **Access Dashboard**: Go to Land Owner Dashboard → Land Reports
